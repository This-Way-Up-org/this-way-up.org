# Legal Disclaimer - Not Legal Advice

## This Way Up Makes No Guarantee of Validity

This Way Up is an open-content collaborative resource aggregation website; that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups working to develop a common resource of information about community services and resources. The structure of the project allows anyone with an Internet connection to alter its content. Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate, or reliable information.

That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information on This Way Up; much of the time you will. However, This Way Up cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. The content of any given article may recently have been changed, altered, or updated by someone whose knowledge does not correspond with current service availability or requirements. Note that most other resource directories and reference works also have disclaimers.

## No Formal Peer Review

Our community of contributors uses various tools and methods to monitor and update content about available resources. However, This Way Up is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or update outdated information, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even articles that have been verified or updated recently may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view them.

None of the contributors, administrators, or anyone else connected with This Way Up in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate information or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.
