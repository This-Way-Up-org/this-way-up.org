<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

**Trustroots** is a hospitality exchange network where travelers connect with hosts offering free places to temporarily stay. Making and having an account on the site is completely free. It serves as a friendly, volunteer-run alternative to commercial hospitality platforms.

<h2 id="how-to-access">How To Access</h2>

You can join Trustroots through the official website: [www.trustroots.org](https://www.trustroots.org/).  
Registration involves creating a profile, confirming your email, and agreeing to the community’s code of conduct. Once your profile is set up, you can start exploring hosts, travelers, and interest groups.

<h2 id="how-to-use">How To Use</h2>

### Creating a Profile

A complete and detailed profile helps others get to know you and increases your chances of finding hosts or guests. Include photos, travel interests, and clear information about your hosting preferences.

### Link Accounts

Other decentralized hospitality exchange networks can be linked to on a person's trustroots profile. These include couchers.org, bewelcome.org, couchsurfing.com, and warmshowers.org; as well as profiles from Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub.

### Joining Circles

**Circles** are Trustroots’ way of connecting people with shared lifestyles or passions—such as *hitchhiking*, *cycling*, *vegan living*, *music*, or *art*. You can join multiple circles and use them to filter search results.

### Exploring the Map

Trustroots uses a **map-based interface** that makes it easy to browse members by location. You can filter results based on circles, recent activity, or language preferences.

<h2 id="finding-hosts">Finding Hosts</h2>

1. **Search by Location:**  
   Use the interactive map to look for potential hosts in your destination area. Searching outside major city centers often improves your chances.

2. **Review Host Profiles:**  
   Read each host’s description, preferences, and notes about their home or lifestyle to ensure compatibility.

3. **Send Personalized Requests:**  
   Address hosts by name, reference details from their profile, and clearly specify your travel dates. Personalized, thoughtful messages receive better responses.

4. **Confirm Your Stay:**  
   Stay in touch before arrival and exchange alternative contact methods in case of internet or communication issues.

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>

### Building Community and Trust

- Creating and linking external accounts not only expands the possible hosts one can reach out to, but also increases the validity of one's own Trustroots profile. Supporting they are who they say they are.
- Be respectful, honest, and considerate in all interactions.  
- Attend local meetups or events to connect with community members.  
- Write **references** after your stays to help maintain transparency and safety.

### Giving Back

Host travelers when possible. Hosting not only helps others but also strengthens your profile and builds trust within the community.

### Staying Safe

All stays are based on mutual consent. Trust your instincts—if something doesn’t feel right, you can decline or leave. Always keep a backup accommodation option such as a hostel or hotel.
