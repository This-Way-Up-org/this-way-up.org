<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

The Address First method is a structured approach for individuals who lack permanent residency and need to recover identity documentation to access economic opportunities. This method emphasizes using **temporary, legally verifiable addresses**—via mutual aid networks, hosts, or shelter providers—paired with **notarized alternative documentation**, to enable identity verification and eventual economic participation, such as gig work.

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

The approach unfolds in sequential stages:

1. **Temporary Address Acquisition** – Establish legitimate residency at a temporary host or shelter.  
2. **Document Bundle Creation** – Collect alternative IDs and notarize them to support identity verification.  
3. **Identity Verification** – Contact SSA or other agencies to verify identity using notarized documents.  
4. **Birth Certificate Retrieval** – Use SSA-issued Social Security number and notarized documents.  
5. **State ID Issuance** – Obtain government-issued photo ID with birth certificate, SSN, and proof of residency.  
6. **Independent Housing** – Rent a single room to establish a permanent address.  
7. **Economic Access** – Use ID and bank account to participate in gig work or minimal-income opportunities.

### Alternative Identity Documents - Detailed Acquisition Methods

#### Educational Records

**Transcripts**
- **How to Request**: Contact the registrar's office of any school previously attended (elementary through college)
- **Required Information**: Full name, approximate dates of attendance, date of birth, any student ID numbers if remembered
- **Methods**: Phone call, online portal, written request, or in-person visit
- **Cost**: Typically $5-25 per transcript, though many schools waive fees for hardship cases
- **Processing Time**: 3-10 business days for most institutions
- **Verification Use**: Transcripts contain your full legal name, date of birth, and are considered official government-accepted documents for Social Security verification

**Enrollment Verification Letters**
- **How to Request**: Contact current or former school's student services or registrar office
- **Required Information**: Student information and specific dates of enrollment needed
- **Cost**: Usually free or minimal fee ($5-10)
- **Processing Time**: Same day to 3 business days
- **Verification Use**: Confirms identity and can establish residency for specific time periods

#### Institutional Records

**Jail/Prison Records**
- **Booking Paperwork**: Contact the facility where you were processed
- **Required Information**: Full name, approximate booking date, any booking number if available
- **Methods**: Call the records department, visit in person, or submit written request
- **Cost**: Typically free for basic booking information
- **Processing Time**: Immediate to 5 business days
- **Verification Use**: Booking paperwork is government-issued documentation with photo and personal information that Social Security Administration accepts

**Court Records**
- **How to Request**: Contact clerk of court for any jurisdiction where you had legal proceedings
- **Required Information**: Case number (if known), full name, approximate date of proceedings
- **Cost**: $5-20 for certified copies
- **Processing Time**: Same day if visiting in person, 5-10 days by mail
- **Verification Use**: Court documents establish legal name and can serve as secondary verification

#### Shelter Verification Letters

**How to Obtain**
- **Process**: Request from any shelter where you've stayed, even briefly
- **Required Information**: Dates of stay, full name used during stay
- **Format**: Letter on shelter letterhead stating your stay dates and current homeless status
- **Cost**: Free
- **Processing Time**: Same day to 2 business days
- **Verification Use**: Social Security Administration specifically accepts shelter verification letters as proof of homelessness, which qualifies for alternative verification processes

**What the Letter Should Include**
- Your full legal name
- Dates of shelter stay
- Statement of current housing status
- Shelter's official contact information
- Signature from authorized shelter staff

#### Employment Records

**EquiFax Work Number Database**
- **Access Method**: Call 1-800-367-5690 or visit theworknumber.com
- **Required Information**: Social Security number, previous employer names, approximate employment dates

- **Processing Time**: Immediate online or phone verification
- **Verification Use**: Provides official employment history that can establish identity timeline

**Direct Employer Contact**
- **Process**: Contact HR departments of previous employers
- **Required Information**: Employee ID (if known), dates of employment, department worked in
- **Documents Available**: Pay stubs, W-2 forms, employment verification letters
- **Cost**: Usually free for basic verification letters
- **Processing Time**: 3-7 business days
- **Verification Use**: Employment records with your Social Security number serve as strong identity verification

**State Employment Department Records**
- **Access Method**: Contact your state's employment/workforce development department
- **Required Information**: Social Security number, previous employer information
- **Available Records**: Unemployment benefit history, wage reports from employers
- **Cost**: Free for personal records
- **Processing Time**: 5-10 business days
- **Verification Use**: State employment records are government documents that establish work history and identity

#### Additional Alternative Documents

**Medical Records**
- **How to Request**: Contact any hospital, clinic, or doctor's office where you received treatment
- **Required Information**: Full name, date of birth, approximate treatment dates
- **Cost**: $10-25 for copies, often waived for indigent patients
- **Processing Time**: 5-15 business days
- **Verification Use**: Medical records contain personal information and can support identity claims

**Military Records**
- **How to Request**: Submit Standard Form 180 to National Personnel Records Center
- **Required Information**: Full name, service number, branch of service, dates of service
- **Cost**: Free for veterans
- **Processing Time**: 15-30 business days
- **Verification Use**: Military records are federal documents providing strong identity verification

**Bank Records**
- **How to Request**: Contact any bank where you previously held accounts

- **Cost**: $5-15 per document
- **Processing Time**: 3-10 business days
- **Verification Use**: Bank signature cards and account documents can establish identity for verification purposes

#### Important Notes

**Document Authentication**
- Request official copies on letterhead when possible
- Ensure documents include official signatures or stamps
- Ask for certified copies when available for stronger verification value

**Multiple Document Strategy**
- Obtain 2-3 different types of alternative documents to strengthen verification
- Use documents from different time periods to establish identity timeline
- Combine institutional and non-institutional sources for broader verification base

**Record Keeping**
- Maintain copies of all documents obtained
- Store originals safely once received
- Keep contact information for institutions in case additional documents are needed

### Notarization Strategy

Notarizing these documents validates **the authenticity of signatures and endorsements**, enhancing credibility when submitting to government agencies. While notarization does not guarantee SSA acceptance, it strengthens cases and helps in advocacy escalation.

<h2 id="implementation-steps">Implementation Steps</h2>

1. **Secure Temporary Residency**
   - Contact mutual aid networks or shelters.  
   - Obtain a signed proof-of-residency letter from a property-owning host (the host functions as “temporary landlord”).  
2. **Compile Available Documentation**
   - Gather all secondary IDs (school, employment, shelter, or institutional records).  
   - Notarize the bundle for added credibility.  
3. **SSA Identity Verification**
   - Use notarized bundle to request Social Security card replacement.  
   - Be prepared for manual review or additional verification steps.  
4. **Birth Certificate Retrieval**
   - Request with SSN plus notarized alternative documents.  
   - Apply for fee waivers if eligible.  
5. **State ID**
   - Use birth certificate, SSN, and proof-of-residency letter to obtain state ID.  
6. **Transition to Independent Address**
   - Rent a single room; update all documentation with new address.  
7. **Economic Access**
   - Open bank account; engage in gig work, remote platforms, or freelance activities.

<h2 id="proof-of-residency">Proof of Residency</h2>

- **Temporary Host Letter** – Signed letter confirming actual residency; attach host ID and optional utility bill.  
- **Notarized Document Bundle** – Confirms identity for agency review.  
- **Transition to Own Address** – Once a room is rented, all official documents and accounts should reflect the new address.

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer & Considerations</h2>

- **Jurisdictional Variability**: Not all states accept private host letters as proof of residency; SSA, DMV, and bank policies differ.  
- **Notary Limitations**: Notarization does not certify factual accuracy; it only verifies the signer’s identity.  
- **Timeline Uncertainty**: Recovery process may take weeks to months depending on agency backlog and local rules.  
- **Legal Compliance**: All addresses and documents must reflect truthful, accessible information.  
- **Support Networks**: Engagement with local legal aid, social workers, or nonprofit advocates improves success likelihood.  
- **Economic Realities**: Gig work is variable income; consider supplemental income or micro-grant support.
